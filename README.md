In League of Legends, the Jungle position is the starting point for most of the pacing, 
and it plays a crucial role in the direction of a match. If you can predict the position and movement of the opponent's Jungle, 
you will have an advantage in the game, and this is an awareness that some high-scoring players have. 

This project is mainly based on the information of the minimap and uses Deep learning as a tool to acheieve the real-time prediction of the enemy's Jungle position.
